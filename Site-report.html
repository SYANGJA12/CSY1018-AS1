I had learnt to design a responsive portfolio website by using HTML and CSS. I have made five page of portfolio website that  contain home, portfolio, contact, blog and site-report page. In home page, i have used some simple basic tagline and describe briefly own bio. Firstly i had linked all files with css. I have used nav and ul tag for the menu in all pages. AS well to make it responsive all the files are linked with the mobile css.</h5>

              For the andriod app i have use the hamburger icon. The main puroose of the hamburger button is to preserve screen space by hidding navigational elements. The icon itself is small and implies  hidden list that can be revealed with a click or press. In contact page i have made the forms by using form tag as well as made the send button. Then the blog page is more tricky and difficult that i have found. In this page i have made three entries that is save images from google and placed them into column wisely. I had searched different website examples on google thats also help me to improve on my assignment. Different types of websites helps to choose color and make attractive my website. To choose the background color i had used linear gradient as well as codpen to improve the website. Although i have also used htnl validator to check the eror on my file.
